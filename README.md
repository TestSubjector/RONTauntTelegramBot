# RONTauntBot
A playful Telegram bot made to send the [taunts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=270326450) (2-5 sec audio clips) from
the Rise of Nation videogame to a chat containing the bot.

Run by -
* Creating a bot_token.txt file that contains your bot API.
* Running the Python code as ```python rontauntbot.py```.
* Then in a chat that contains your bot, type ```Taunt X``` where X ranges from 1-100 to get that required taunt audio clip.
